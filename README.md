## Introduction
Social media platforms like Twitter have become one of the most popular sources of information and communication, especially among young people. Millions of tweets are posted every day on various topics ranging from news, politics, sports, entertainment, and more. These tweets contain a wealth of information, including people's opinions, thoughts, and sentiments about various topics.

Therefore, our project aims to address these challenges by developing a system that can perform sentiment analysis and tag prediction on tweets accurately. We believe that this project can provide valuable insights to companies, individuals, and researchers by allowing them to make informed decisions and discover new information.
